## Explanation document about data flow in HTTP requests and how React JS library works

* HTTP is a protocol that provides commands in communication between networks, where this is a client computer with a web server. Later, the client computer will make a request by accessing the domain URL or IP address. Then the request will be managed or executed by the web server according to the code entered.
An HTTP client or also known as a user agent usually starts a request by making a connection to a certain port on the web hosting server. Then the web server responds and saves the resource, this is called the origin server.

Between the user agent and the origin server there may be something that bridges it, for example gateways, tunnels and proxies. Next, the resource you want to access with HTTP will be identified using a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) using the http: or https: URL scheme.

* React is a JavaScript library used to build interactive user interfaces. This library is made by Facebook and is open source. This library is very popular in use and is always being developed by both the main contributors and the community.
